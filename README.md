# NOBO_app

This app was created for tracking state goals regarding, and abundance of the Northern Bobwhite (NOBO). In its completed form it will be intended for use by internal U.S. Fish and Wildlife staff to visualize NOBO abundance and trends over the last 20 years. The NOBO data was collected by the USGS and is published annually in the Breeding Bird Survey data.

Note that the file size for the Leaflet map is quite large and can take several seconds to load.
